# Project Summary

## Overview of Implementation
No features or tasks were implemented. The repository contains only the initial project documentation and specifications (`README.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md`, and `LICENSE`). The `progress.md` file was not found, and no Go source code or package structure has been initialized.

## Files Changed or Created
No source code files were changed or created. The only document created was:
- `SUMMARY.md`

## Notable Decisions or Trade-offs
Because no development occurred, no technical decisions, architectural choices, or trade-offs were made regarding the provider abstraction, the concurrent worker pool, local state store, or the terminal UI.

## Final Outcome
The final outcome is that the project remains completely in its initial state. The requirements and technical specifications outlined in the `spec.md` were **not satisfied**, as zero development tasks have been executed.
